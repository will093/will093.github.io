For any JavaScript project, whether it be frontend or backend, we usually rely on a number of third party npm packages - these might be frameworks, utility libraries or build tools.

This is because, understandably, we do not want to 'reinvent the wheel'. Often using a framework and a few well selected third party utility libraries will speed up the development of and increase the maintainability of an application. 

However, when not used with discretion, these third party packages can be harmful to your project - you must remember that each package that you decide to use can introduce security, maintainability, performance and legal issues.

In this article I will go through the questions that you should be asking yourself when deciding whether you should use a particular npm package in your project.

# 1) Is the package being actively maintained?
# 2) Does the package introduce a security risk?
# 3) Does the package require a licence?
# 4) Will the package be flexible enough for your requirements?
# 5) How heavy is the package?
# 6) How difficult would it be to write the functionality provided by the package yourself?
# 7) Does the package have a clean, well documented API?
