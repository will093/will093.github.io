I am a freelance web developer based in Bristol UK. I have 6 years experience building full stack web applications. I work with a large variety of technologies including Angular, Ionic, RxJS, Vue, Svelte, TypeScript, Node.js and Express.js.

When I am not programming I like to spend my time going to gigs, bouldering, and growing fruit and vegetables. 

## Projects

These are my favourite personal projects that I have built. For my professional history and projects, please take a look at [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/will-s-taylor/).

### Easy Recorder app

[Easy Recorder](https://easy-recorder.herokuapp.com) is small voice recorder app that I built using Angular and Ionic. It works using the browser Web Audio API and runs as a web app and PWA.
