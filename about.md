My name is Will Taylor, I live in the vibrant city of Bristol, UK.

I am a freelance full stack developer specialising in Angular and JavaScript, and I have been doing web development professionally for around 4 1/2 years. 

When I am not programming something, I am usually engaged in one of the many other things I am passionate about, such as music, growing fruit and vegetables (and mushrooms), bouldering, hiking, and wild camping.

I started willtaylor.blog because I wanted a place to document some of the more useful things I have done and more valuable lessons that I have learned from my work. In doing so I have discovered that I actually quite enjoy writing, and the process of iteratively improving my writing. I have also gained a new guilty pleasure of continuosly checking my Google Analytics to examine my very slowly increasing trickle of traffic :)
