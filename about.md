My name is Will Taylor, I live in the vibrant city of Bristol, UK.

I am a freelance full stack developer specialising in Angular and JavaScript, and I have been practicing web development professionally for 5 years. 

When I am not programming I am most often found making music, growing fruit, vegetables and mushrooms, or bouldering.

### My blog

I started willtaylor.blog because I wanted a place to document some of the valuable lessons that I have learned from my work, and because I find it rewarding to explain technical concepts through writing.
